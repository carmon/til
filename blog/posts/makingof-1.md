How is this blog made? #1
=========================

This is a static blog bundled all [in the same repository](https://github.com/carmon/til).
Every inch that you see is possible with the Vercel magic, which allowed me to use a
serverless approach for a minimal API. Front code is bundled by Rollup, I'm really new
to it, so it could be poor configured, all these years under webpack ruling are a hard
obstacule when trying to learn new overly complicated compiling/transpaling/bundling stuff.

My idea behind this blog is to post cool code-hacks that I needed, this post got a little
away to the norm because I'm testing multiple md files/posts. 

Feel free to visit the repo to check out, find a bug, make an issue or just fork it.
