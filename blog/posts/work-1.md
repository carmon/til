Looking for work
================

After a summer hiatus from working as a developer (still coding as a hobby), I'm back
into the race of looking for a new job. If you see this and are interested in my experience
in Github APIs, apps and workflows, you can send me an email to elcarmon[at]gmail[dot]com.

Don't forget to check out my [Github profile](https://github.com/carmon) and my [personal page](https://carmon.dev/), made with React.Js and textarea-ui, a personal project to emulate old 
text UIs in a browser (I'm back updating it with new features). I'm also working in a videogame,
I will make the repo public soon... stay tuned.
