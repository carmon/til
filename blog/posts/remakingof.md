How is this blog made?
======================

A friend of mine told me 'this blog could be static', so I removed all of the previous code.

Now a node app is run and generates the `index.html` file with all the MDs and some JS injection.
The result? Plain static page, avoid re-rendering, and fs stat working! well, sort of...
